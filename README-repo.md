# Klippy

This repo was autogenerated using tools at https://github.com/Laikulo/klippy-tooling.

It contains a python-packaged version of klipper's host daemon from https://github.com/Laikulo/Klipper.

This repo contains patches nessecary to run as a python package, as well as a few other patches that I use personally.

To figure out what git version this corresponds to, check klippy/.version, it will contain a git short SHA of the klipper that was repackaged into this repo.
